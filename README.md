## CERMBscraper

An R package with functions to extract selected content from fire-related
documents such as Incident Action Plans (PDF format) produced by the NSW 
Rural Fire Service.

Written for the Centre for Environmental Risk Management of Bushfires,
University of Wollongong, Australia. The package may be freely used 
but it probably isn't any use to you unless you work with New South Wales
bushfire data.


### Installation

``` r
# Uncomment this line and run it if you don't have the `remotes` package

# install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("mbedward/CERMBscaper")

```
